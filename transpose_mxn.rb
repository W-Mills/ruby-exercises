# Transpose MxN
# In the previous exercise, you wrote a method to transpose a 3 x 3 matrix as represented by a ruby Array of Arrays.

# Matrix transposes aren't limited to 3 x 3 matrices, or even square matrices. Any matrix can be transposed by simply switching columns with rows.

# Modify your transpose method from the previous exercise so it works with any matrix with at least 1 row and 1 column.

# Examples:

def transpose(matrix)
  new_matrix = []
  num_rows = matrix.size
  num_cols = matrix.first.size
  (0...num_cols).each do |col_ind|
    new_row = (0...num_rows).map { |row_ind| matrix[row_ind][col_ind] }
    new_matrix << new_row
    end
  new_matrix
end


p transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4]]) == [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
p transpose([[1], [2], [3], [4]]) == [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
p transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 7, 8, 6, 2]]) ==
  [[1, 4, 3], [2, 3, 7], [3, 2, 8], [4, 1, 6], [5, 0, 2]]
p transpose([[1]]) == [[1]]
