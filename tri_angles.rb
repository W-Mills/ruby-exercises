# Tri-Angles
# A triangle is classified as follows:

# right One angle of the triangle is a right angle (90 degrees)
# acute All 3 angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees
# obtuse One angle is greater than 90 degrees.
# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the angles must be exactly 180 degrees, and all angles must be greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the 3 angles of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :right, :acute, :obtuse, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is a right, acute, obtuse, or invalid triangle.

# You may assume integer valued angles so you don't have to worry about floating point errors. You may also assume that the arguments are specified in degrees.


# Input: 3 integers
# Output: a symbol

# Problem: Write a method that takes the 3 angles of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol depending on which type of triangle it is

# :invalid
# => sum of all angles != 180
# => any angles <= 0

# :right 
# => one angle == 90

# :acute
# => all angles < 90

# :obtuse
# => one angle > 90 

def triangle(*angles)
  return :invalid if angles.sum != 180 || angles.any?{ |angle| angle <= 0 }
  return :right if angles.any?(90)
  return :acute if angles.none?{ |angle| angle >= 90 }
  return :obtuse if angles.any?{ |angle| angle > 90 }
end


# Examples:

p triangle(60, 70, 50) == :acute
p triangle(30, 90, 60) == :right
p triangle(120, 50, 10) == :obtuse
p triangle(0, 90, 90) == :invalid
p triangle(50, 50, 50) == :invalid
