# Fibonacci Numbers (Last Digit)
# In the previous exercise, we developed a procedural method for computing the value of the nth Fibonacci numbers. This method was really fast, computing the 20899 digit 100,001st Fibonacci sequence almost instantly.

# In this exercise, you are going to compute a method that returns the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number.




# def fibonacci_last(nth)
#   first, last = [1, 1]
#   3.upto(nth) do
#     first, last = [last, first + last]
#   end

#   # last.digits[0] ## very slow
#   # last.to_s[-1].to_i ## also too slow
# end



def fibonacci_last(nth)
  last_2 = [1, 1]
  3.upto(nth) do
    last_2 = [last_2.last, (last_2.first + last_2.last) % 10]
  end

  last_2.last
end

# Examples:

puts fibonacci_last(15)        # -> 0  (the 15th Fibonacci number is 610)
puts fibonacci_last(20)        # -> 5 (the 20th Fibonacci number is 6765)
puts fibonacci_last(100)       # -> 5 (the 100th Fibonacci number is 354224848179261915075)
puts fibonacci_last(100_001)   # -> 1 (this is a 20899 digit number)
puts fibonacci_last(1_000_007) # -> 3 (this is a 208989 digit number)
puts fibonacci_last(123456789) # -> 4
